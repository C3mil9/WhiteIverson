        Double OT
        I'm a new three
        Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
        I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', oh-ooh (swaggin')
        I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you (swish, ooh, ayy)
        Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
        That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot, yeah
        Spendin', I'm spendin' all my f- pay

        I got me some braids and I got me some -
        Started rockin' the sleeve, I can't ball with no Joes (ball with no Joes)
        You know how I do it, Concords on my toes
        (This shit is hard) ooh
        I ain't rich yet, but you know I ain't broke, I
        So, if I see it, I like it, buy that from the store, I (store, I)
        I'm with some white girls and they lovin' the - (they lovin') like they OT

        Double OT like I'm KD, smokin' OG (smokin' OG)
        And you know me, in my 2-3s and my gold teeth (and my gold teeth)
        I'm smiling, b- you see me from the nosebleeds (nosebleeds)
        I'm the new three, and I change out to my new 3s (to my new 3s)
        White Iverson, when I started ballin', I was young
        You gon' think about me when I'm gone
        I need that money like the ring I never won, I won

        Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
        I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', oh-ooh
        I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you
        Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
        That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot, yeah
        Spendin', I'm spendin' all my f- pay

        Ooh, Stoney
        Cigarettes and a headband
        Commas, commas in my head, man
        Slumped over like a dead man
        Red and black, 'bout my bread, man
        I'm the answer, never question
        Lace up, learn a lesson

        Bitch, I'm saucin' (wow), I do this often, don't do no talkin' (no)
        My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans (ooh)
        I'm ballin', money jumpin' like I'm Davis from New Orleans
        Or -, I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
        Practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it (ayy)
        I have it, I never pass it, I work my magic
        High average, ball on these -, it makes me happy
        It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'

        White Iverson
        When I started ballin', I was young
        You gon' think about me when I'm gone
        I need that money like the ring I never won, I won

        Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
        I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', oh-ooh
        I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you
        Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
        That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot, yeah
        Spendin', I'm spendin' all my f- pay

        Ooh, ooh
        Ooh, ooh
        Ooh, ooh
        Ooh, ooh
